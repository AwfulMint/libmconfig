# libmconfig
A simple dynamic lib for loading configurations.

## How to build
- Open solution in Visual Studio.
- Select the Configuration (Debug or Release) and the Platform (x86 or x64).
- Right click the project libmconf and click Build.

Search for the files libmconf.dll (or libmconf.so I guess) and libmconf.lib. The lib file should be included in the project additional libs and the dll in the same folder as your program executable.

Or you can use the prebuilt binaries I provide in the Releases section here in GitHub.
